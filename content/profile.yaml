  about: |
    Dedicated Full-Stack developer with a knack for Backend. Experienced in multiple databases, technologies & domains.

    Refactoring for optimisation and maintainability has become a bad habit and finding patterns in large datasets has become a second nature. Having worked in various industry domains and multiple technologies (both languages and databases) has given me a different perspective of what fits where and what an application needs at a given point in time.
